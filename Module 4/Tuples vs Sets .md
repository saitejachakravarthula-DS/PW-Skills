# Comparison of the use cases for tuples and sets in Python programming:

| Use Case                    | Tuples                                                     | Sets                                                        |
|-----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Immutable Data Storage**  | Ideal for storing fixed sets of data that shouldn't change | Not applicable, as sets are mutable                          |
| **Function Return Values**  | Returning multiple values from a function                  | Not applicable                                              |
| **Dictionary Keys**         | Can be used as keys in dictionaries because they are immutable | Cannot be used as dictionary keys due to mutability          |
| **Data Integrity**          | Ensures data remains constant throughout the program       | Not applicable                                              |
| **Memory Efficiency**       | Uses less memory compared to lists                         | Uses more memory due to the need for maintaining uniqueness  |
| **Removing Duplicates**     | Not applicable                                             | Automatically removes duplicate entries                      |
| **Membership Testing**      | Not as efficient as sets                                   | Highly efficient for membership testing                      |
| **Mathematical Set Operations** | Not applicable                                        | Supports union, intersection, difference, and symmetric difference |
| **Tracking Unique Items**   | Not applicable                                             | Useful for tracking unique items in a collection             |
| **Filtering Data**          | Not applicable                                             | Efficient for filtering data based on membership             |
| **Set-Based Algorithms**    | Not applicable                                             | Useful for algorithms involving set operations               |

| **Function Return Values**   | `def get_user_info(): return ("Alice", 30)`                  | Not applicable                                                |
| **Dictionary Keys**          | `locations = {(34.0522, -118.2437): "Los Angeles"}`          | Not applicable                                                |
| **Data Integrity**           | `WEEK_DAYS = ("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday")`             | Not applicable                                                |
| **Memory Efficiency**        | `import sys; print(sys.getsizeof((1, 2, 3)))`                | `import sys; print(sys.getsizeof({1, 2, 3}))`                 |
| **Removing Duplicates**      | Not applicable                                               | `numbers = [1, 2, 2, 3]; unique_numbers = set(numbers)`       |
| **Membership Testing**       | `coordinates = (1, 2, 3); 1 in coordinates`                  | `vowels = {'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'}; 'a' in vowels`           |
| **Mathematical Set Operations** | Not applicable                                           | Applicable |

| **Filtering Data**           | Not applicable                                               | `allowed_items = {"apple", "banana"}; items = ["apple", "date"]; filtered_items = [item for item in items if item in allowed_items]` |
| **Set-Based Algorithms**     | Not applicable                                               | `A = {1, 2, 3}; B = {3, 4, 5}; common_elements = A & B`        |
